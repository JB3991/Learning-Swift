# Learning Swift 

## Description
As of December 2020 i had no knowledge of any lanague or code so i decided to change that. I Started learning Swift from youtube, Udemy and Apple documents. 
A good starting point i the book "Intro into app development with swift" by Apple. This is where I started and from here I started watching Youtube and bought a Udemy course. 

I started to document everythig I was learning into this repository so i could alway refer back to it in the future.
